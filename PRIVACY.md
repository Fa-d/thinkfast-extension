## Overview

Intently is a browser extension designed to help you build healthier browsing habits through mindful interventions and usage tracking. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Information We Collect

### Local Storage (Always Active)

The following data is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's storage API:

This data **never leaves your device** unless you explicitly enable cloud sync.

If you choose to sign in with Google for cloud sync:

- **Email address**: Used for authentication only
